# Portfolio page

A web page I made for the [Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage) freeCodeCamp challenge.

See the [portfolio page in action](https://steviegill-webportfolio.netlify.app/) here.
